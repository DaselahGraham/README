#### Introduction

In today’s rapidly evolving healthcare industry, understanding the factors that influence medical costs is essential. By analyzing demographic and geographic data, we can gain insights into patterns that can help insurance companies, policy makers, and individuals make more informed decisions about healthcare. The dataset provided contains information about a variety of personal attributes (such as age, gender, BMI, family size, smoking habits), geographic regions, and medical insurance charges. This project aims to uncover how different features relate to healthcare costs, answering business questions such as:

- Does a person’s location affect their insurance cost?
- Do smokers incur higher medical expenses than nonsmokers?
- Does a higher BMI result in higher healthcare costs?

Through data wrangling, analysis, and modeling, this post explains how to answer these questions and highlights the techniques used to handle categorical data and missing values, making it relevant for real-world applications.

#### Business Context and Real-World Applications

In the context of the insurance industry, the insights gained from this dataset can help businesses predict healthcare expenses and set pricing models. Insurance companies need to assess risk factors associated with their clients to offer fair yet competitive prices. By analyzing factors such as location, smoking habits, and BMI, insurers can build predictive models for risk assessment.

For example:
- **Geographic Influence**: If the data shows that individuals from the Southeast region tend to incur higher charges on average, insurers can adjust premiums for clients from this region to better reflect the risk.
- **Smoking Habits**: If smokers have higher healthcare expenses, insurance providers may offer higher premiums to smokers to cover the added risk of chronic conditions.
- **BMI and Health Costs**: Recognizing the connection between higher BMI and increased healthcare costs allows insurers to tailor health-related benefits or preventive programs for individuals with higher BMI categories.

In real-world applications, this analysis can guide insurance companies in improving customer segmentation, pricing strategies, and the development of more tailored policies for their clientele. Additionally, healthcare professionals can use these insights to recommend lifestyle changes and preventative care based on risk factors.

#### Data Exploration and Analysis

##### 1. **Data Overview**

Upon loading the dataset, we performed an initial inspection to understand its structure and identify any anomalies. The dataset contains 1,338 rows and 7 columns:
- **age**: The age of the individual.
- **sex**: The gender of the individual.
- **bmi**: The Body Mass Index of the individual.
- **children**: The number of children/dependents covered by the insurance plan.
- **smoker**: Whether the individual is a smoker (yes/no).
- **region**: The geographic region in which the individual resides (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest).
- **charges**: The medical insurance charges for the individual.

The dataset is clean, with no missing values, and there are no duplicated rows after deduplication.

##### 2. **Categorical Data Handling**

In this dataset, there are three categorical variables: `sex`, `smoker`, and `region`. Here's how they were handled:

- **Sex and Smoker Variables**: These are binary categorical variables. To analyze their relationship with the charges, we used group-by operations to compute the mean charges for each category.
- **Region**: The `region` column represents four geographic areas. We grouped the data by region to compute the average charges in each region, which allows us to analyze how geographical factors impact healthcare costs.

```python
# Example of handling categorical data by grouping and calculating the mean charges
region_costs = df.groupby("region")["charges"].mean()
```

##### 3. **Missing Data Handling**

The dataset does not contain any missing values, as confirmed by the `df.info()` call. This is a positive attribute of the dataset, as missing data can often complicate analysis and modeling. However, in real-world scenarios, missing data can be handled in various ways, such as:

- **Imputation**: For numerical columns, missing values could be filled with the mean, median, or mode.
- **Removal**: Rows with missing values might be dropped if they are not numerous enough to affect the overall analysis.
- **Categorical Handling**: For categorical columns, missing values might be replaced by the most frequent category or a new category indicating missing data.

##### 4. **Data Wrangling and Feature Engineering**

Data wrangling and feature engineering are key steps in preparing the data for analysis. In this case, a new feature was created to categorize BMI values into meaningful groups (e.g., "Underweight", "Normal weight", "Overweight", and "Obese").

```python
def bmi_category(bmi):
    if bmi < 18.5:
        return "Underweight"
    elif 18.5 <= bmi < 24.9:
        return "Normal weight"
    elif 25 <= bmi < 29.9:
        return "Overweight"
    else:
        return "Obese"

# Apply BMI categorization to the dataset
df["bmi_category"] = df["bmi"].apply(bmi_category)
```

This transformation adds an insightful dimension to the data, allowing us to analyze how different BMI categories affect medical charges.

#### Data Visualization and Insights

##### 1. **Geographic Region and Charges**

The first business question examined was whether a person’s location affects their medical costs. We grouped the dataset by region and computed the average charges for each region. A bar graph was used to visualize this, which showed that the Southeast region had the highest average charges, followed by the Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest regions. This insight suggests that the Southeast might be a high-risk area for insurance companies, requiring higher premiums.

```python
region_costs = df.groupby("region")["charges"].mean()
region_costs.sort_values(ascending=False).plot(kind="bar", color="skyblue", edgecolor="black")
```

##### 2. **Smoker vs. Non-Smoker Charges**

To answer the question of whether smokers have higher medical expenses, we grouped the data by smoking status and calculated the average charges for each group. The analysis revealed that smokers indeed have significantly higher medical charges compared to non-smokers, which is consistent with common health knowledge and supports the need for higher premiums for smokers.

```python
smoker_costs = df.groupby("smoker")["charges"].mean()
smoker_costs.plot(kind="bar", color=["skyblue", "salmon"], edgecolor="black")
```

##### 3. **BMI and Charges**

The final business question tackled whether a higher BMI results in higher healthcare costs. By categorizing individuals into BMI groups and analyzing the average charges per group, it was clear that individuals classified as "Obese" had the highest average medical charges, followed by "Overweight" individuals. This reinforces the need for targeted healthcare policies for individuals with higher BMI.

```python
bmi_costs = df.groupby("bmi_category")["charges"].mean()
bmi_costs.reindex(["Underweight", "Normal weight", "Overweight", "Obese"]).plot(kind="bar", color="lightgreen", edgecolor="black")
```

#### Modeling and Predictive Insights

While the current code does not include explicit machine learning models, the insights derived from this exploratory data analysis can be used as the foundation for building predictive models. For example:
- **Predictive Modeling**: A regression model could be built to predict healthcare charges based on features like age, sex, BMI, smoking habits, and region.
- **Risk Classification**: Classification models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) could be trained to classify individuals into high-risk or low-risk categories for insurance purposes.

By leveraging the relationships between features and charges, predictive models can be fine-tuned to provide accurate predictions of healthcare costs for new clients, helping insurers optimize their pricing strategies.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, this analysis demonstrates how demographic and geographic data can be used to answer key business questions regarding healthcare costs. By grouping the data based on categorical features like region, smoker status, and BMI, and using simple aggregation techniques, we were able to uncover meaningful patterns that reflect real-world relationships.

The handling of categorical and missing data, as well as the use of data wrangling techniques like BMI categorization, allowed us to effectively transform and analyze the data. These insights not only aid insurance companies in pricing policies but can also inform healthcare professionals and policymakers about the factors driving healthcare costs.

This work can be further extended by building predictive models, incorporating additional features, and using advanced machine learning techniques to refine the insights and provide more granular risk assessments.
