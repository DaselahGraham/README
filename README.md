# GitHub Repository Post: Analyzing Healthcare Costs Using Demographic and Geographic Data
## Introduction
In today’s rapidly evolving healthcare industry, understanding the factors that influence medical costs is essential. By analyzing demographic and geographic data, we can gain insights into patterns that can help insurance companies, policy makers, and individuals make more informed decisions about healthcare. The dataset provided contains information about a variety of personal attributes (such as age, gender, BMI, family size, smoking habits), geographic regions, and medical insurance charges. This project aims to uncover how different features relate to healthcare costs, answering business questions such as:

##### Does a person’s location affect their insurance cost?
##### Do smokers incur higher medical expenses than nonsmokers?
##### Does a higher BMI result in higher healthcare costs?

Through data wrangling, analysis, and modeling, this post explains how to answer these questions and highlights the techniques used to handle categorical data and missing values, making it relevant for real-world applications.

## Business Context and Real-World Applications
In the context of the insurance industry, the insights gained from this dataset can help businesses predict healthcare expenses and set pricing models. Insurance companies need to assess risk factors associated with their clients to offer fair yet competitive prices. By analyzing factors such as location, smoking habits, and BMI, insurers can build predictive models for risk assessment.
For example:

#### Geographic Influence: 
If the data shows that individuals from the Southeast region tend to incur higher charges on average, insurers can adjust premiums for clients from this region to better reflect the risk.

#### Smoking Habits: 
If smokers have higher healthcare expenses, insurance providers may offer higher premiums to smokers to cover the added risk of chronic conditions.
#### BMI and Health Costs: 
Recognizing the connection between higher BMI and increased healthcare costs allows insurers to tailor health-related benefits or preventive programs for individuals with higher BMI categories. In real-world applications, this analysis can guide insurance companies in improving customer segmentation, pricing strategies, and the development of more tailored policies for their clientele. Additionally, healthcare professionals can use these insights to recommend lifestyle changes and preventative care based on risk factors.

## Data Exploration and Analysis

### Data Overview
Upon loading the dataset, we performed an initial inspection to understand its structure and identify any anomalies. The dataset contains 1,338 rows and 7 columns:
age: The age of the individual.
sex: The gender of the individual.
bmi: The Body Mass Index of the individual.
children: The number of children/dependents covered by the insurance plan.
smoker: Whether the individual is a smoker (yes/no).
region: The geographic region in which the individual resides (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest).
charges: The medical insurance charges for the individual.
The dataset is clean, with no missing values, and there are no duplicated rows after deduplication.

### Categorical Data Handling
In this dataset, there are three categorical variables: sex, smoker, and region. Here's how they were handled:
Sex and Smoker Variables: These are binary categorical variables. To analyze their relationship with the charges, we used group-by operations to compute the mean charges for each category.
Region: The region column represents four geographic areas. We grouped the data by region to compute the average charges in each region, which allows us to analyze how geographical factors impact healthcare costs.
